To update the model simply edit the "model.ump" file then compile with Umple plugin.

To install Umple plugin:
- Download the jar file: cruise.umple.eclipse_1.19.0.3287.jar
 
 https://code.google.com/p/umple/downloads/detail?name=cruise.umple.eclipse_1.19.0.3287.jar&can=2&q=
 
- Copy the Jar file to Eclipse/plugin folder.

- When you get the Umple icon on the tool bar,
 choose the file you want to compile ( in our case "model.ump") then simply click the icon.
 
 This will generate the Java files from the Umple model. Therefore, any update to the model should be done to the Umple model.
